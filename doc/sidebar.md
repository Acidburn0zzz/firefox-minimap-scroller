The sidebar module is responsible for the creation of the XUL elements forming
the sidebar, and handling of sidebar-related events.

It's a fork of https://builder.addons.mozilla.org/package/25177/revision/26/
which fixes a number of bugs and add a couple features, such as customization
of the sidebar's position.
